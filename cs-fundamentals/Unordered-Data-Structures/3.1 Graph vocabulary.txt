Node = Vertex
n = number of vertices in the graph
m = number of edges

incident edge:
edge that directly connects to that node
degree of node:
count of how many incident edges that it has
adjacent vertices:
every single vertex is adjacent to a node
Cycle:
path with common begin and end vertex
simple graph:
a graph with no self loops or multi-edges
subgraph:
a subset of graph

complete subgraph:
connected subgraph:
connected component:
acyclic subgraph:
spanning tree:

runnnig time are often reported by n, but often depend on m

How many edges?
minimum edges:
- not connected: 0
- connented: n-1

maximum edges:
- simple graph: each node has edges to every other node -> n*(n-1)/2 = O(n*2)
- not simple: +inf

sum of all the degrees of all of the nodes: 2*m (node A and B has outbound edge and inbound edge although they are the same)
